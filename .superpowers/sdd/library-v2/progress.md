# Library v2 Expansion — Progress Ledger

Branch: `library-v2-expansion` (worktree: `.worktrees/library-v2`)
Base: `main` @ aac1e7a (91 patterns, merged and deployed)

## Scope (5 phases, user-approved 2026-08-11)

Source audit against DesignGurus System Design Patterns course, Azure
Architecture Center patterns + antipatterns catalogs, Educative Grokking
Modern System Design Interview, and roadmap.sh/system-design identified
gaps. User approved all 5 phases below, explicitly declined "copy paste
content" from any source (paywalled or free) — all content is original
writing informed by research, never verbatim, regardless of repo
visibility (repo is public and deployed, confirmed via API).

### Template v3 (applies to all new + retrofitted pattern pages)
Definition -> Diagram -> Problem it solves -> **Technical Architecture &
Implementation** (expanded from "How it works": protocol-level detail,
data flow, failure modes) -> Code example (Rust) -> When to use it ->
When not to use it -> **Use-Case Scenarios** (2-3 concrete vignettes,
expanded from single "Real-world example") -> Related patterns ->
Further reading.

### Phase 1 — Gap-fill (15 pages, built directly at v3)
12 missing patterns + 3 concept-to-pattern promotions:
- Caching group (NEW `course/patterns/caching/`): Cache-Aside,
  Read-Through, Write-Through, Write-Behind, Cache Stampede Prevention
- Consistency/Storage/Reliability gaps: Leader Election, Primary-Replica
  Replication, Failover, Federation, Pipes and Filters
- API-edge + concept promotions: API Versioning, Service Discovery,
  Load Balancing, Reverse Proxy, CDN

### Phase 2 — New catalogs (15 pages, built directly at v3)
- AI Agent Orchestration (NEW group): Sequential, Concurrent, Group Chat
  (+ Maker-Checker), Handoff, Magentic orchestration
- Azure Antipatterns (NEW group, "what not to do"): Busy Database, Busy
  Front End, Chatty I/O, Extraneous Fetching, Improper Instantiation,
  Monolithic Persistence, No Caching, Noisy Neighbor, Retry Storm,
  Synchronous I/O

### Phase 3 — Deep-rewrite pass (91 existing pages -> v3)
Original 60: full build-out (diagram + code + v3 sections, currently
have none of this). The 31 pages from the just-merged phase: add the
v3 Technical Architecture + Use-Case Scenarios sections (already have
diagram + code).

### Phase 4 — Design-X case studies (~17 new, original content)
Educative-inspired full system walkthroughs missing from
`course/case-studies/system-design/`: Uber, WhatsApp, Instagram,
YouTube, Google Maps, Yelp/Proximity Service, Newsfeed, TinyURL,
Typeahead, Google Docs, ChatGPT, Payment System, Deployment System,
Data Infrastructure, LLM Support Bot, Code Assistant, etc.

### Phase 5 — Source cross-linking pass (full library)
Add the matching topic link from each of the 4 sources (where it
exists, DesignGurus/Educative only if the specific lesson is free) to
Further Reading across the full final inventory. Runs last — needs the
final page set settled.

## Task log

### Phase 1 Task A — Caching group (5 pages) — COMPLETE
Commit `317e1f4`. Cache-Aside, Read-Through, Write-Through, Write-Behind,
Cache Stampede Prevention under new `course/patterns/caching/` (position
12). Built directly at v3 (Technical Architecture & Implementation +
Use-Case Scenarios). Manifest bumped 91->96. Review: clean, no fixes,
explicitly flagged as a template reference for remaining tasks —
write-through/write-behind comparison treated with real rigor on both
sides, use-case vignettes concrete and non-generic, zero disallowed
citations, all Rust compiles, build clean.

### Phase 1 Task B — Consistency/Storage/Reliability gaps (5 pages) — COMPLETE
Commit `483033e`. Leader Election (consistency), Primary-Replica
Replication + Federation (storage), Failover (reliability), Pipes and
Filters (building-blocks). Manifest bumped 96->101. Review: clean, no
fixes. All 4 required sibling-differentiations (Leader Election vs.
Raft/Paxos, Failover vs. Bulkhead/Circuit Breaker/Graceful Degradation,
Primary-Replica vs. Sharding, Federation vs. Federated Identity) verified
correct and quotably explicit — Federation/Federated-Identity confusion
resolved with an explicit "Not to be confused with" callout. Zero
disallowed citations, all Rust compiles, build clean, no dead links.
